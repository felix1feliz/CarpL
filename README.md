# CarpL Compiler

CarpL (or Carp Language) is a toy language for messing with logical operators. CLC (or CarpL Compiler) turns the toy language into nasm x86_64 for gnu-linux. To run clc you need node. Here is the command for using clc:
```bash
node clc.js
```

I hope you enjoy my lang :3

#### IF YOU ARE CURIOUS

The entry function is named 'main' because it is a very original name.
